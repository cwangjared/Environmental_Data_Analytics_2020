## 1) Discussion Questions

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: I have taken an undergraduate course called Environmental Data Analysis with R. The courses focused on data clean up and subset, and included a little bit data visualization and analysis, e.g. Q-Q plot, etc. I used packages such as ggplot, tidyr, and dplyr. I have no previous experience with Git.

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I am relatively confident about the course content in January

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: I am relatively unfamiliar with time series data, spatial data exploration, and metadata.

## 2) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file.
